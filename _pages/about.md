Hi there! I'm Dhruv Sharma, a rising Junior at UC San Diego studying Computer Engineering. I am actively involved in research on campus and in student clubs as the President of the Computer Science and Engineering Society's (CSES) Innovate community, a research focused organization aimed to reduce the barriers to entry into AI and deep learning research. 

My work focuses on the intersection of Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Science, with a keen interest in Generative AI, Predictive Modeling, and Algorithmic Systems. I've developed high-fidelity character animations in Unreal Engine 5.3 , integrated chain-of-thought methodologies to train context-aware autonomous agents, and optimized training pipelines using Docker and Kubernetes.

Outside of work, you will find me either cycling, swimming, running, or playing any racquet sport. I love a great game of squash and would never turn down a game of pickleball. I've maintained a consistent gym schedule for the past 3 months, and have no intention to break my record.
